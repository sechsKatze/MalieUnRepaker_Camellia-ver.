MalieUnRepaker_Camellia-ver.
======
A dedicated unpack/repack tool for the Malie engine, written in Python, along with its source code.

The Malie engine unpacking code used in this tool was forked from [GARbro](https://github.com/morkt/GARbro)  [v1.1.6](https://github.com/morkt/GARbro/releases/tag/v1.1.6) (by  by  [morkt](https://github.com/morkt/GARbro)) and ported to the Python programming language.

The Camellia decryption key table list is derived from code written by morkt and [asmodean](http://asmodean.reverse.net)
, the author of [exdieslib](https://github.com/regomne/chinesize/blob/master/Malie/exdieslib/exdieslib.cpp)
.
Many thanks to them for their work.
